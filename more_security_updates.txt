Track:

* User agent
* Screen resolution
* Time zone
* Installed fonts
* Mouse movement patterns

🟡 Can detect repeat access from fake browsers, but also **has GDPR/privacy concerns**

Use libraries like:

* FingerprintJS (JS-based)
* Your own session fingerprint hashes

## ✅ 6. **Cloudflare Bot Management**

If your domain is live, Cloudflare offers:

* Bot score detection
* JS challenge pages

## ✅ 8. **Use Signed URLs or Tokens**

For high-value content (downloads, video links, etc.), serve via:

* Expiring links
* Signed tokens with HMAC

This prevents bots from directly accessing URLs even if they’re scraped.
